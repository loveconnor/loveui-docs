LoveUI Skills is a reusable skill package for coding agents that need to build high-quality product UI with LoveUI.

It works with any AI coding agent — no specific provider required.

It provides concrete rules for visual direction, layout systems, state coverage, and production-ready UX patterns.

## What It Includes

- A structured workflow from scope definition to implementation and quality checks.
- A design quality bar for typography, spacing, color, component APIs, and responsive behavior.
- Agent UX requirements for sensitive actions: Plan, Preview, Apply, plus undo and history patterns.
- Guidance to use LoveUI MCP as the source of truth before selecting packages or components.

## Required MCP Usage

The skill expects the `loveui` MCP server to be available and used during UI work:

- Call `resources/list` to discover available registry items.
- Call `get-loveui-package` to fetch exact package JSON before implementation.
- Treat MCP responses as authoritative instead of relying on memory.

## Default Prompt

```text
Use $loveui-skills to create a beautiful, professional web app/page with LoveUI and production-ready UX quality.
```

## Skill Source

The full skill definition lives on GitHub at [github.com/loveconnor/loveui-skills](https://github.com/loveconnor/loveui-skills).

The core skill file is `SKILL.md` at the root of the repository.
