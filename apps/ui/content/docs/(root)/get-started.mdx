This guide helps you install LoveUI quickly.

## Project checklist

Before you start, make sure your app has:

- React
- Tailwind CSS v4
- A global stylesheet (for example `app/globals.css`)

## Install with CLI

Use the CLI to add components and required dependencies:

```bash
npx love-ui@latest add loveui
```

Run this command in your project root.

## Install manually

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Open a component page in the docs.
2. Copy the code from the **Code** tab.
3. Paste it into your project.
4. Install any listed dependencies.

Use [Styling](/docs/styling) to add the required CSS variables.

## Where to browse components

- [Components](/docs/components/button)
