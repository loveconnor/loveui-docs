## What is LoveUI?

**LoveUI** is an open-source UI library for React apps.

It gives you ready-to-use components that are:

- Accessible
- Composable
- Easy to style with Tailwind CSS

You can copy components into your project and adjust them to match your design.

## Why LoveUI?

Many UI libraries give you only styles.

LoveUI gives you structure and behavior too, so you can ship faster.

Core principles:

- **Composable:** small parts that work well together
- **Accessible:** keyboard and screen-reader friendly
- **Flexible:** easy to adapt to your design system

---

## What makes it different?

LoveUI is built to be practical.

It includes real UI patterns, not only visual shells.

You can start with defaults and scale to a custom system over time.

---

## Who is it for?

LoveUI is for teams that want to move fast without losing quality.

It works well for:

- Startups shipping product quickly
- Teams building reusable UI systems
- Developers who want production-ready patterns

---

## Open Source and Community

LoveUI is open source under the **MIT license**.

You can read the code, use it, and contribute improvements.

We welcome bug fixes, docs updates, and new components.
