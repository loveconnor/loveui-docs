## What is LoveUI?

**LoveUI** is a modern, open-source component library that helps you build beautiful, functional UIs faster.  
Every component is handcrafted for accessibility, responsiveness, and composability — with real functionality, not just styled markup.

Whether you need tables, file dropzones, or AI-driven chat components, LoveUI gives you production-ready pieces you can drop directly into your app.  
It’s built for **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, making it easy to use in modern frontend projects.

## Why LoveUI?

Most UI libraries give you styles. LoveUI gives you **structure and logic** — components that actually do things.  
From interactive editors to complete dashboard sections, every piece is designed to save development time while keeping full control over customization.

Each component follows a few simple principles:
- **Composable:** Small parts that fit together naturally.
- **Accessible:** Built with keyboard and screen reader support by default.
- **Unopinionated:** Style it however you like with Tailwind.
- **Extendable:** Use as-is or build your own design system on top.

## What makes it different?

LoveUI isn’t tied to another framework or library — it’s a standalone system built from the ground up.  
That means you’re not limited by someone else’s conventions or theme.  
You get complete freedom to design, extend, and scale your components however you need.


They’re ready to use, yet flexible enough to adapt to any project.

## Who is it for?

LoveUI is made for **developers and teams who want to move fast without cutting corners**.  
If you’re building with React and want to ship polished, accessible features quickly, this library is for you.

It’s perfect for:
- Startups looking to accelerate product development  
- Developers building custom design systems  
- Teams that want consistent, reusable UI patterns

## Open Source and Community

LoveUI is fully open source under the **MIT license**.  
You can explore the code, learn from it, and adapt it however you like.  
We welcome contributions — from small fixes to new components.

👉 Check out our [Contributing Guide](/ui/docs/contributing) to learn how to get involved.

By building in the open, we’re growing a community of developers and designers who believe in **accessible, flexible, and composable UI for everyone**.
