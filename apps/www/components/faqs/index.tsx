    title: "What is LoveUI?",
    content:
      "LoveUI is our opinionated React component library, complete with backgrounds, marketing blocks, and documentation used across loveui.dev. It gives you the exact building blocks we rely on to ship new surfaces fast.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-2",
    title: "Which frameworks are supported?",
    content:
      "Every component is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. They work instantly in Next.js, and drop into other React setups with minor adjustments to routing or data fetching.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-3",
    title: "Can I customize the look and feel?",
    content:
      "Yes. Tokens for color, typography, spacing, and radius mirror the theme config documented across the LoveUI design kit, so you can override decisions globally or per component without rewriting markup.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-4",
    title: "Do the components cover accessibility?",
    content:
      "We bake in keyboard support, focus management, and ARIA attributes. LoveUI sits on top of Base UI primitives, so accessibility isn’t an afterthought—it’s part of the contract.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-5",
    title: "How often do you ship updates?",
    content:
      "We dogfood LoveUI on our marketing site and docs, so enhancements land weekly. The changelog highlights new blocks, backgrounds, and fixes as soon as they’re available.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-6",
    title: "Can I request a new component?",
    content:
      "Absolutely. Open an issue or drop us a note with your use case. We prioritise components that benefit the broader community and share progress publicly.",
