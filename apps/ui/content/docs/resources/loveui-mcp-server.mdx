title: Love UI MCP Server
description: Serve every Love UI registry definition through the Model Context Protocol.
---

The Love UI MCP server exposes the entire local registry over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), letting agents and copilots browse and install components without leaving their IDE. The server ships with the CLI so it stays in sync with every package in this repository.

## Getting Started

Run the server directly via `npx`:

```bash
npx loveui-mcp
```

The server runs over stdio, which means any MCP-compatible client can talk to it with no extra configuration.

## Resources

Each registry item is published as a resource using the `loveui://registry/{name}` scheme. When `apps/ui/public/r` is available, the MCP server serves every generated registry entry (components, feature variants, and examples). It also falls back to package-based generation when those files are not present.

For example, the base badge definition is available at:

```text
loveui://registry/badge
```

Reading the resource returns the same JSON schema used by `https://www.loveui.dev/r/{name}.json`, so your AI tools can hydrate files exactly as the CLI would.

## Tools

The server also provides a `get-loveui-package` tool for programmatic access by registry item name:

```json
{
  "name": "get-loveui-package",
  "input": { "name": "badge" }
}
```

Calling the tool returns a single text response containing the registry JSON for the requested package.

## Client Configuration

- **Claude Desktop** – Add a custom server pointing to `npx loveui-mcp`.
- **Cursor / Windsurf** – Use the MCP integration and register the command `npx loveui-mcp`.
- **Custom agents** – Use `@modelcontextprotocol/client` and connect over stdio to reuse the resource and tool endpoints.

Because the server generates registry data from the checked-in packages, it always reflects the latest local changes (including unpublished components).
