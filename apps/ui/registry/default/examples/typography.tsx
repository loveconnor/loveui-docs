      <h1>The Art of Sourdough: From Starter to Artisan Loaf</h1>

      <p>
        Few things are as satisfying as pulling a perfectly golden,
        crackling sourdough loaf from your own oven. The ancient art of wild
        yeast fermentation has experienced a renaissance, with home bakers
        around the world cultivating their own{" "}
        <code>starter cultures</code> and mastering the delicate
        balance of flour, water, time, and temperature.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        Creating your first sourdough starter is a journey that requires
        patience and attention. Unlike commercial yeast, wild yeast and
        beneficial bacteria work slowly, developing complex flavors that simply
        cannot be rushed or replicated with instant ingredients.
      </p>

      <h3>Essential Equipment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Large mixing bowl (glass or ceramic preferred)</li>
        <li>Kitchen scale for precise measurements</li>
        <li>Dutch oven or baking stone</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Basic Ingredients</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bread flour (12-13% protein content)</li>
        <li>Filtered or spring water (chlorine-free)</li>
        <li>Your active sourdough starter</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Baking Day Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <input checked disabled type="checkbox" />{" "}
          <p>Feed starter 8-12 hours before</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input disabled type="checkbox" />{" "}
          <p>Mix and autolyse dough</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input disabled type="checkbox" />{" "}
          <p>Complete stretch and folds</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Visual Guide</h2>
      <p>
        A properly developed loaf should have an open, airy crumb
        structure with irregular holes. The crust should be deep golden brown
        with natural caramelization.

      <h2>Starter Recipe</h2>
      <pre>
        <code>{`Day 1: Mix 50g flour + 50g water
Day 2-7: Discard half, feed daily
Week 2: Ready when doubles in 4-6 hours
Temperature: 75-80°F (24-27°C) optimal`}</code>

      <h2>Baker's Wisdom</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "Bread baking is one of those almost hypnotic businesses, like a
        dance from some ancient ceremony. It leaves you filled with one of the
        world's sweetest smells... there is no chiropractic treatment, no Yoga
        exercise, no hour of meditation in a music-throbbing chapel that will
        leave you emptier of bad thoughts than this homely ceremony of making
        bread." — M.F.K. Fisher

      <h2>Tips & Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        Always use <strong>high-quality flour</strong> Updated
        for best results, <em>organic when possible</em>.{" "}
        <u>Temperature control</u> is crucial — consider using a{" "}
        <a href="https://example.com">proofing box or heating pad</a>
        . The <code>stretch and fold</code> technique
        develops gluten without kneading.
      </p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Autolyse</dt>
        <dd>
          Resting period where flour absorbs water before adding starter
          and salt
        </dd>
        <dt>Bulk Fermentation</dt>
        <dd>
          First rise after mixing, typically 4-6 hours at room
          temperature
        </dd>
        <dt>Banneton</dt>
        <dd>Proofing basket used to support dough during final rise</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Why is my bread too dense?</summary>
        <p>
          Dense bread often results from under-fermentation,
          insufficient gluten development, or weak starter. Ensure your starter
          passes the float test and allow adequate bulk fermentation time.
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        Master bakers focus on{" "}
        <strong>precise hydration ratios</strong> and{" "}
        <em>careful temperature management</em>.{" "}
        <u>Score patterns</u> aren't just decorative — they
        control <a href="https://example.com">oven spring direction</a>.{" "}
        <mark>The key is consistent practice</mark> and{" "}
        <small>making detailed notes</small>.{" "}
        <abbr title="Percentage of water to flour">
          Hydration
        </abbr>{" "}
        typically ranges from 65-85%.
      </p>

      <h2>Baker's Math</h2>
      <p>
        Professional bakers use percentages: 1000g flour at 75%
        hydration requires 750g water
        <sup>*</sup>. Common chemical leavening uses CO<sub>2</sub>{" "}
        production.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Sourdough baking is equal parts science and art. Every loaf
        teaches you something new about fermentation, gluten development, and
        the interplay of time and temperature. Keep detailed notes, trust the
        process, and remember that even imperfect loaves taste wonderful fresh
        from the oven.
