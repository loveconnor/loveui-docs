Welcome to the first milestone for LoveUI. This changelog tracks what shipped with the public launch and what’s available today across components, tooling, and documentation.

## February 2025 • LoveUI launch

### Layered component system

- Introduced **40+ primitives** built on Base UI with LoveUI tokens, accessibility sweeps, and usage examples.
- Shipped the first wave of **building blocks**—production patterns like onboarding flows, billing summaries, and navigation shells.
- Released three procedural **backgrounds** (Ether, Silk, Gradiant Blinds) tuned for both marketing pages and in-product canvases.

### Tooling and developer experience

- Published the `loveui` CLI with `npx loveui add <component>` support, dependency syncing, and project-aware file placement.
- Bundled an **MCP server** (`npx loveui-mcp`) that exposes the entire registry to AI copilots over stdio.
- Provided Tailwind v4 tokens, copy-to-clipboard snippets, and llms.txt metadata to keep AI workflows in sync with the docs.

### Documentation & sites

- Launched the new docs experience at `ui.loveui.dev` with responsive previews, background demos, and roadmap visibility.
- Added marketing surfaces on `loveui.dev`, including the beams hero, component highlights, and background gallery.
- Documented installation paths, styling guidance, and roadmap visibility for upcoming Atoms, theme packs, and integrations.
