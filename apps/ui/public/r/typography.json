The ancient art of wild yeast\n        fermentation has experienced a renaissance, with home bakers around the\n        world cultivating their own <code>starter cultures</code> and mastering\n        the delicate balance of flour, water, time, and temperature.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Getting Started</h2>\n      <p>\n        Creating your first sourdough starter is a journey that requires\n        patience and attention. Unlike commercial yeast, wild yeast and\n        beneficial bacteria work slowly, developing complex flavors that simply\n        cannot be rushed or replicated with instant ingredients.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Essential Equipment</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Large mixing bowl (glass or ceramic preferred)</li>\n        <li>Kitchen scale for precise measurements</li>\n        <li>Dutch oven or baking stone</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3>Basic Ingredients</h3>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Bread flour (12-13% protein content)</li>\n        <li>Filtered or spring water (chlorine-free)</li>\n        <li>Your active sourdough starter</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <h2>Baking Day Checklist</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <input checked disabled type=\"checkbox\" />{\" \"}\n          <p>Feed starter 8-12 hours before</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <input disabled type=\"checkbox\" /> <p>Mix and autolyse dough</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <input disabled type=\"checkbox\" /> <p>Complete stretch and folds</p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>Visual Guide</h2>\n      <p>\n        A properly developed loaf should have an open, airy crumb structure with\n        irregular holes. The crust should be deep golden brown with natural\n        caramelization.\n      </p>\n      <center>\n        <Image\n          alt=\"Artisan sourdough bread\"\n          height={400}\n          src=\"https://placehold.co/600x400\"\n          unoptimized\n          width={600}\n        />\n      </center>\n\n      <h2>Starter Recipe</h2>\n      <pre>\n        <code>{`Day 1: Mix 50g flour + 50g water\nDay 2-7: Discard half, feed daily\nWeek 2: Ready when doubles in 4-6 hours\nTemperature: 75-80°F (24-27°C) optimal`}</code>\n      </pre>\n\n      <h2>Baker's Wisdom</h2>\n      <blockquote>\n        \"Bread baking is one of those almost hypnotic businesses, like a dance\n        from some ancient ceremony. It leaves you filled with one of the world's\n        sweetest smells... there is no chiropractic treatment, no Yoga exercise,\n        no hour of meditation in a music-throbbing chapel that will leave you\n        emptier of bad thoughts than this homely ceremony of making bread.\" —\n        M.F.K.

Ensure your starter passes the float\n          test and allow adequate bulk fermentation time.\n        </p>\n      </details>\n\n      <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>\n      <p>\n        Master bakers focus on <strong>precise hydration ratios</strong> and{\" \"}\n        <em>careful temperature management</em>. <u>Score patterns</u> aren't\n        just decorative — they control{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://example.com\">oven spring direction</a>.{\" \"}\n        <mark>The key is consistent practice</mark> and{\" \"}\n        <small>making detailed notes</small>.{\" \"}\n        <abbr title=\"Percentage of water to flour\">Hydration</abbr> typically\n        ranges from 65-85%.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Baker's Math</h2>\n      <p>\n        Professional bakers use percentages: 1000g flour at 75% hydration\n        requires 750g water\n        <sup>*</sup>.

Every loaf teaches you\n        something new about fermentation, gluten development, and the interplay\n        of time and temperature. Keep detailed notes, trust the process, and\n        remember that even imperfect loaves taste wonderful fresh from the oven.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default Example\n",
