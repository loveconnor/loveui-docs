Thank you for helping improve LoveUI.

This page explains the easiest way to contribute.

## What you can contribute

You can help by:

- Fixing bugs
- Improving docs
- Adding new UI components
- Adding examples
- Improving accessibility

## Quick steps

1. Fork the repo and clone it.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make a small, focused change.
4. Run formatting and build checks.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description.

## Commands to run before you open a PR

```bash
bun run format:write
bun run registry:build
```

If you changed core UI components, also run:

```bash
bun run ui:propagate
```

## Write clear pull requests

Please include:

- What changed
- Why you changed it
- Screenshots (if UI changed)
- Any breaking changes

Small pull requests are easier to review and merge quickly.
