title: Love UI MCP Server
description: Serve every Love UI registry definition through the Model Context Protocol.
---

The Love UI MCP server exposes the entire local registry over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), letting agents and copilots browse and install components without leaving their IDE. The server ships with the CLI so it stays in sync with every package in this repository.

## Getting Started

Run the published server via `npx`:

```bash
npx -y --package=love-ui@latest loveui-mcp
```

For local development in this repository:

```bash
cd /Users/connorlove/projects/loveui-docs/packages/loveui
bun run build
node dist/mcp-server.js
```

The server runs over stdio, so any MCP-compatible client can talk to it directly.

## Resources

Each registry item is published as a resource using the `loveui://registry/{name}` scheme. The server prefers the registry snapshot (`public/r`) and falls back to package-based generation when needed.

For example, the base badge definition is available at:

```text
loveui://registry/badge
```

Reading the resource returns the same JSON schema used by `https://www.loveui.dev/r/{name}.json`, with MCP-specific safety normalization (internal package dependencies are filtered and install hints are included).

## Tools

The server also provides a `get-loveui-package` tool for programmatic access by registry item name:

```json
{
  "name": "get-loveui-package",
  "input": { "name": "badge" }
}
```

Calling the tool returns a single text response containing the registry JSON for the requested package.

Internal packages (such as `shadcn-ui`, `typescript-config`, and similar workspace-only packages) are intentionally excluded from MCP listing and direct lookup.

## Client Configuration

- **Claude Desktop** – Add a custom server pointing to `npx -y --package=love-ui@latest loveui-mcp`.
- **Cursor / Windsurf** – Use MCP integration and register `npx -y --package=love-ui@latest loveui-mcp`.
- **Custom agents** – Use `@modelcontextprotocol/client` and connect over stdio to reuse the resource and tool endpoints.

When running from npm, MCP uses the published package snapshot. When running locally from this repo, MCP reflects local changes after rebuilding.
