# Design Directions

Choose exactly one direction per project unless the user asks for mixed styles.

## 1) Editorial Premium

- Typography-first hierarchy with restrained color.
- Strong spacing discipline and subtle separators.
- Best for: marketing pages, product narrative, docs.

## 2) Data-Rich Enterprise

- Dense but readable information zoning.
- Strong table/chart readability and utility controls.
- Best for: dashboards, admin tools, operations software.

## 3) Modern SaaS Crisp

- Clean medium-density layout with clear calls to action.
- Soft radii, controlled shadows, limited accent color.
- Best for: SaaS products, onboarding, account flows.
- Also strong for: agent workflows where you want guided “Plan → Preview → Apply”.

## 4) Minimal Product Studio

- Low ornamentation and deliberate whitespace.
- Strong alignment precision and calm interaction design.
- Best for: focused tools, portfolio, productivity apps.

## 5) Bold Campaign

- High-impact hero and conversion-first section flow.
- Strong anchors, large typography, selective motion.
- Best for: launches, event pages, acquisition landers.

## 6) Technical Console

- Utility-first, fast-scanning interface style.
- Compact controls and explicit status signaling.
- Best for: developer tools, monitoring, internal platforms.
- Also strong for: agent tooling where logs, diffs, and provenance must be always visible.

## Selection Checklist

- Match audience expectations.
- Match information density.
- Match brand voice.
- Confirm readability and contrast.

### Agent UX Fit Checks

If the UI includes an agent:

- Prefer **Technical Console** for power users (dense, explicit status + logs).
- Prefer **Modern SaaS Crisp** for mixed audiences (guided steps + clearer affordances).
- Ensure the direction supports:
  - a clear primary action,
  - visible system status,
  - readable diff/log surfaces,
  - consistent “apply” affordances.
